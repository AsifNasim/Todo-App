# Todo-App

This is a simple To Do Application in react.In this application, I've used React components, React forms, event handlers etc.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### To Start Project in Development Mode

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
